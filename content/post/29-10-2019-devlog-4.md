I used Max Woolf's "Train a GPT-2 Text-Generating" model on Google Drive to train the AI on my German translations. The trained text looked very similar to the inputted text, and I think I need to compile a longer text doucment of all my archival translations for the model to train on. I faced several problems with Google Drive including a failed training run and multiple failed uploads of the training text to Google Drive. Now Google Drive fails to open the colab sheet or run the training model.

I am undecided if I should fix the grammatical errors and shorthand from my translations for the AI to train properly, or if the imperfect translation, syntax and short forms make for a less realistic and thus less obvious computer generated text. I am also unsure if this is the best next step forward, or if I need an alterantive option.
