I created a test Chatbot on Snatchbot today. I read the Emotive Project's tutorial on building a chatbot and played with the different contexts and models for discussion. There are several premade models for chatbots, but many of Snatchbot's models are designed for data collection buisness models, rather than academic, educational or entertainmnet purposes. 

Even following the tutorial, creating a chatbot is not intuitive. Snatchbot and Emotive Project's tutorial make the steps easy to follow, but neither speak directly to my purposes and are thus inherently problematic. I want to create an interaction between an AI prison guard and a human engaging as a prisoner. Many of the models for the chatbot are formatted on the "if/then" framework--meaning if the chat participant says "X" then the chatbot says or does "Y." The problem? I can only think of so many *logical* responses to accusations of lesbianism and conseuqential imprisonment in the ephemeral and intangible digital environment of a chatroom.
