# Devlog 3: Idea breakdown

I imput my German archival translations into Text to Transformer and got some scary results. 
Not only was the text borderline pornographic, but it was offensive and generated hate speak toward the LGBTQ+ community. The code also could not translate the original German text, demonstrating a silence in the AI platform. 

I'm moving away from the idea of creating a fake social media profile based on this breakdown. I wanted to post archival images and use Text to Transform to generate a "caption," but with the test outcome there are too many consequences to that direction. Instead I'm going to play with the CTRL code and see if I can generate less offensive narratives. I'm still considering the Milennial to Snake People code to specifically manipulate the new narrative, and using they/them pronouns insead of specific gendered terminology. This effectively trains the new AI to transcribe or generate new text. Shawn suggested I check out Tiffany Chan's AI code and methodology.
