# Devlog 1: Mindmapping

Thinking about our seminar on reverse designing, I thought I'd map my project ideas. 

+ utilize the Javascript milennial-to-snake-people code
+ try to use the deepfake code to create a queer history?
+ queerify a timeline of world events?
+ compose a transnational history of real queer events?
+ create a fake queer history?
+ implement real social media platform design?
+ Britania-esque history page?
+ manipulate a Google result?

## Guerilla aspects

+ **making** people download the Javascript code to see the queerified text
+ imposing a transnational narrative on the concept of the local LGBTQ+ museum
+ manipulating a narrative to tell a purposefully "fake" or idealized history
