I am becoming more aware of systemic challenges in artificial intelligence and coding. Take for example the name of my preferred chatbot site, Snatchbot. To *snatch* is to abruptly seize something in an unpolite way. As I've mentioned in earlier devlogs, Snatchbot seems to be designed to scrape data such as the user's name and contact information for subscription lists. There is a pejorative understanding associated to such terminology and behaviour. But what if it is consciously used to simulate understanding of historical contexts and empathy for human experience?
