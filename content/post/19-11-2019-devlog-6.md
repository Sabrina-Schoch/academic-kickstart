I am becoming more aware of systemic challenges in artificial intelligence and coding. Take for example the name of my preferred chatbot site, Snatchbot. To *snatch* is to abruptly seize something in an unpolite way. As I've mentioned in earlier devlogs, Snatchbot seems to be designed to scrape data such as the user's name and contact information for subscription lists. There is a pejorative understanding associated to such terminology and behaviour. But what if it is consciously used to simulate understanding of historical contexts and empathy for human experience?

What if the only way to understand human experience is to be forced to digitally experience a similar situation? What if giving a machine agency over its user the is the best way to demonstrate and appreciate personal liberty and freedom?
