I've been considering how my work has evolved through the process of this project. 

I initially wanted to create a queered social media platform that contested a national narrative. I wanted to tell a story that transgressed borders and realities, and I considered doing so by fictionalizing queer history. I imagined something like a FaceBook page with a rainbow theme that demonstrated freedom of speech over a series of social media posts created by fictionalized and queered people. I reconsidered this project based on the amount of work in creating a FaceBook-esque platform, and the ethicality of generating queer text.

My next idea was to train an AI model on the German archival documents I'm analyzing for my Masters dissertation. I ran a series of tests on an AI software modeled on reddit, and quickly abandoned that idea. The generated text incorporated hate speech and other racist, misogynistic and otherwise problematic ideologies that contested the open, educational and safe space I was trying to create. 

I finally decided to create a chatbot who posed as a German camp guard, and have the user engage as a lesbian inmate. The problem of user agency diametrically opposed the authoritarian regime I was simulating, but this idea proved the most managable and ethical and the least problematic.
